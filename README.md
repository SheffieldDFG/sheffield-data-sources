# Where can we get data about Sheffield?

Sheffield Council's Socrata platform: https://data.sheffield.gov.uk/ (it's rubbish, let me know if you find anything useful)

I found "neighbourhoods" on data.sheffield.gov.uk https://data.sheffield.gov.uk/dataset/Neighbourhoods-Sheffield/wwma-jstu No idea what they're used for.

Deprivation Indices https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015

Outlines for LSOA and other geographies from Census https://borders.ukdataservice.ac.uk//easy_download_data.html?data=England_wa_2011
